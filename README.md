# Hoppers
Hoppers game for android.  
Start playing by choosing a level from 40 available.  
The goal is to stay with only the red frog on the board.  
On every turn you can hop from one leaf to another only while hopping on top of a green frog (while removing it from the board).  
A hoppable leaf is an empty one.  
All frogs are available for hopping and all moved are allowed (diagonal, backwards, forward...) .  
There is also an option for playing against other hopper players via Bluetooth.
